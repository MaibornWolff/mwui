> Adding a new Web Component should always be discussed with the Design Team to have the right Tokens and Designs in place. We prefer component-specific tokens over semantic or core tokens. Missing tokens are discussed with Design Team.

We use [Github Projects](https://github.com/orgs/MaibornWolff/projects/4/views/1) to organize tasks and issues linked to this Repository.

Follow this checklist to comply with our definition of done.

-   [x] components are tested
-   [x] components are represented in Storybook
-   [x] components are documented (e.g. storybook mdx doc)
-   [x] components are reviewed together with design team
