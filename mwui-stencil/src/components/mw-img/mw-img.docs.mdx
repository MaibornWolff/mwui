# Image

The MwImage component displays an image like a regular img tag but brings some quality of life improvements.

Images can:

- be lazy loaded when visible in the viewport.
- have fallback images in case an image URL is not valid
- can have different resolutions for different viewport sizes
- can have a preloadImg which will display the low resolution img first then switch to the original src
