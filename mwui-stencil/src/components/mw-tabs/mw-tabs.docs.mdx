# Tabs

`mw-tabs` is a wrapper for a group of `mw-tab` components and allows the user to switch the active tab by pressing on it.
The amount of tabs and their appearance is determined by how many `mw-tab` components were placed in the `mw-tabs` slot.

The `selected` prop determines which tab is enabled by default.
A `mw-tab` does not represent tab content but only the selectable tab in the navigation. Implementing behaviour to switch between contents by using `mw-tabs` is up to the application using it.

### Listen to Tab changes

Selecting one of the tabs fires a `click` Event containing the current `selected` property.

```javascript
import type { MwCheckboxCustomEvent } from "@maibornwolff/mwui-stencil/dist/types/components";

const onClick = (event: MwTabsCustomEvent<number>) => {
  console.log("tabs changed/clicked", event.target.selected);
};
```

```javascript
document.getElementsByTagName("mw-tabs")[0].addEventListener("click", event => {
  console.log(event.target.selected);
});
```

<ArgsTable of="mw-tabs" />
