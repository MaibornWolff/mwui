# Tabs

`mw-tabs` is a wrapper for a group of `mw-tab` components and allows the user to switch the active tab by pressing on it.

The amount of tabs and their appearance is determined by how many `mw-tab` components were placed in the `mw-tabs` slot.

The `selected` prop determines which tab is enabled by default.
