### Selected

A `selected` property can be provided to define the initial state of the toggle state.

### With Icon

When providing a `icon` prop containing the name of an icon, a `mw-icon` will be shown at the start of the chip.

<Canvas of={MwChip.Icon} />

### With Avatar

### Close Icon

Any variant of a `chip` can be configured to render a close icon at the end by setting the `close` prop.

### Disabled

Setting the `disabled` prop, the `chip` is visually and functionally disabled and cannot be clicked.
