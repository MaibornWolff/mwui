# Chip

`mw-chip` is the primary component. There are several variants as described below. All variants share an internal `selection` state acting as a toggle when clicked.

### Default

<Canvas withSource="open">
  <Story id="components-chip--default" />
</Canvas>

### With Icon

When providing a `icon` prop containing the name of an icon, a `mw-icon` will be shown at the start of the chip.

<Canvas withSource="open">
  <Story id="components-chip--icon" />
</Canvas>

### With Avatar

<Canvas withSource="open">
  <Story id="components-chip--avatar" />
</Canvas>

### Close Icon

Any variant of a `chip` can be configured to render a close icon at the end by setting the `close` prop.

<Canvas withSource="open">
  <Story id="components-chip--closable" />
</Canvas>

### Disabled

Setting the `disabled` prop, the `chip` is visually and functionally disabled and cannot be clicked.

<Canvas>
  <Story id="components-chip--disabled" />
</Canvas>
